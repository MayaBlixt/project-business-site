# Business Site

The graffiti bootcamp is a mobile first responsive business site with a hero video.

## The problem

Started of the project to make a highlevel sketch in Jamboard with the mobile first approach.
To cretate a responsive hero video i used one vide that i compressed and adapted the video for driffrent screen sizes.
A sign up form with validation was created that can send the information with POST to http://httpbin.org/anything.
FAQ section was created using javascript.
